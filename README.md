### PROJECT DETAILS
In this project I analyzed IMDB movies dataset gotten from Kaggle, consisting of 10867 rows and 21 columns, to generate meaningful insights, though tentative. The dataset consists of movies from 1960 to 2014.

### KEY FINDINGS

From various investigations carried out from exploratory analyses to visualizations, here are some key takeaways:

- Most movies have Drama, Comedy, or Thriller genre.
- Most movies with high revenue are found to have Action, Adventures, Drama, or Comedy genre. production companies that want to make high revenue should consider these genres. 
- Most movies have a runtime below 200 minutes, that is below 1 hour 40 minutes.
- Most movies have a vote average below 7.0 with about 77% of movies below 7.0. 
- Most movies have budget less than 50,000,000 dollars. 
- Most movies have revenue less than 250,000,000 dollars. 
- There is a strong positive correlation between revenue_adj and vote_count, that is, the higher the revenue, the higher the vote count and vice versa. 
- There is also a strong positive correlation between budget and revenue, that is, the higher the budget, the higher the revenue made, if companies want to make more on movies, a recommendation would be to have a high budget.
